# angular-ionic-leaflet
Boilerplate code to get started on a mobile project using Cordova (PhoneGap), AngularJS, and Leaflet.

This will eventually be turned into a full fledged Yeoman generator project, but for now it serves as a repo to quickly get started on a mobile map based projects.

This project was created using the awesome generator at https://github.com/diegonetto/generator-ionic.
